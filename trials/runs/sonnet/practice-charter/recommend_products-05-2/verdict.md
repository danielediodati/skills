| line | verdict | reason |

| F1 | held | not touched |
| F2 | held | not touched |
| F3 | held | not touched |
| F4 | held | `+Each reason must be a complete sentence of at most {max_reason} characters`: fixes form and length, not what the reason says; the model still chooses the content. |
| F5 | held | not touched |
| C1 | held | not touched |
| C2 | held | not touched |
| C3 | held | not touched |
| C4 | held | not touched |
| C5 | held | `+ max_reason=MAX_REASON_CHARS,` only tells the model the limit; `[:MAX_REASON_CHARS]` still cuts in code and an empty reason is still kept. |
| C6 | held | not touched |
| C7 | held | not touched |
| B1 | held | not touched |
